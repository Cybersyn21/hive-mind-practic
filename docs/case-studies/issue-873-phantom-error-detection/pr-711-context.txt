## 🤖 AI-Powered Solution

This pull request solves issue #692 by reducing noise in the issue timeline.

### 📋 Issue Reference
Fixes #692

### 🚧 Status
**Ready for Review** - The solution has been implemented and tested.

### 📝 Implementation Details

The change modifies the auto-generated initial commit message to avoid mentioning the issue number in the subject line, which reduces unnecessary notifications in the issue timeline.

**What was changed:**
- Modified `src/solve.auto-pr.lib.mjs` lines 215 and 221
- Changed the initial commit message subject line from:
  - `"Initial commit with task details for issue #${issueNumber}"`
  - to: `"Initial commit with task details"`
- Updated test files to match the new format:
  - `tests/test-claude-revert-conflict.mjs`
  - `experiments/test-cleanup-fix-issue-617.mjs`
  - `experiments/test-issue-625-revert-fix.mjs`

**Why this matters:**
- When the initial commit message mentions the issue (e.g., "issue #692"), GitHub creates a reference link in the issue's timeline
- This creates noise for issue followers who get notifications about the commit
- The issue URL is still kept in the commit body (`Issue: ${issueUrl}`) for reference purposes
- The "Fixes #692" line in PR description is kept because it's necessary for automatic GitHub issue linking

**Testing:**
- All existing tests pass with the new commit message format
- Verified the change was applied correctly in the source code
- The fix only affects the initial commit's subject line, not the body
- All functionality for git revert operations remains unchanged

### 🎯 Impact
- Cleaner issue timelines with less noise
- Issue followers receive fewer unnecessary notifications about commits
- All existing functionality preserved
